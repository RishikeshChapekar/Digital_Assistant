# Digital_Assistant
A voice controlled digital assistant


This works best with a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian OS). You'll have to modify the code a bit to make it work on Linux systems such as Ubuntu,Fedora,ParrotOS etc.
Would not recommend use on Windows (though if you wish, you will have to make many major changes to the code)

# Required software
1. SQLite3
2. PyAudio
3. Alsa
4. Speech Recognition module of Python
5. Wikipedia module of Python

# Hardware
1. Microphone (I also used a USB sound card to connect the mic to the Pi)
2. LED (If on Pi, this is to indicate when the Pi is listening for input)
